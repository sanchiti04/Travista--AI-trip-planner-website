 How to Add Your Screenshots


Replace `path_to_start_page_screenshot`, `path_to_create_trip_screenshot`, and `path_to_trip_generation_screenshot` with your actual screenshot image paths or URLs (you can upload images to the repo or host them elsewhere).

If you want, I can help you generate the markdown code for embedding your actual images once you share them! Would you like that?
